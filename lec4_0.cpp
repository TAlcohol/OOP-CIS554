// notes for the hw1, Sep 5, 2019
// swap p1 and p2, in doublelinklist,
// save where they pointed to previously first,
// if not consecutive, change 8 pointers
// if consecutive, change 6 pointers
// if node is in the border, their cases could be little different

// don't only swap values, our class is training swap pointers

// first line is comment:
// HW1 by [name]
// submit .txt

// HW1, allow swap values of 2 nodes, HW2 don't allow
// use your own sorting, like bubble sort

// do not change main function

// do not use array to store values

// pay attention to bordering cases, like linklist only have 0,1,2 nodes

// define function, like sort function, should outside the original one
